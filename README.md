# Auto-Motion-Detection-in-CCTV-camera
The Application simply records the video only when there is somemobement detected in front of the camera, and when there's no one in front of camera it dosen't records the video, This indeed saves a lot of data.
A motion detection is a feature that every security camera must have  installed in buildings to measure and detect movement in a given area. The device is used in commercial and residential properties, as well as on  industrial and military premises.

Motion detection systems can be standalone devices or integrated into 
larger security systems. They can be used in a variety of settings, including homes, 
businesses, and public spaces.
